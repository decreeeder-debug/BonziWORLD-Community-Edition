# BonziWORLD Community Edition

**This bonziworld respository houses the source code to BonziWORLD: CE.**
<br>
The source code has been made public because I would like to move on from this project and work on something else. Since it's just been sitting here collecting dust, I figured I should make this public. Who knows, maybe somebody will find this useful.
<br><br>
**This repository is behind in roughly 300 commits!! It is recomended that you use the code from the original repository instead!**

*I will do my best to mirror most of the changes!*
